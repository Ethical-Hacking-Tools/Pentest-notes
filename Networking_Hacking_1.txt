My thoughts about Network Hacking and Red Team Pesting:

In my recent Pentest activities, i've explored so many network environments / systems, and peformed alot of pentest on them. The follow write-up will demostrate the important things which you MUST to know about networking and Post-Explotation phases (from attacker perspective).

Recently i've received a BlackBox Pentest on CONTOSO.COM (name_example for the writeup), and after started to attack Web Services, my boss told me that was a Networking Pentest (LOCALLY), Oh shit!! i'm sooo fucked!. 
When i knew it, i realize that i never did that thing before (only in Post-Exploitation scope and so on...daah!! run autoroute from msfconsole sessions seems to be easy for a noob like me ;/ it happens!). 
In this project i started my researching to learn more about it infrastructure and network attacks. After some exhaustive days reading and testing.. i realized that.. DUDE! Nowdays, networking is totally different from what you learned from your school / courses / certficates...  Really, have you heard about Imperva? InfoBlox? expeeensive firewalls solutions which cost more than 1 million Trumps?? Seriously, i've learned alot in one week of simple researching, and i'm soo depressed T-T .. 
So, Welcome to 2019/2020 where MySQL + Wordpress from your books does not exist anymore! and the Firewall what you looking for bypass, also!.. 
SQL Injection? XSS? RCE? what is this?.. Holy moly! i guess, it was flagged by the CloudFront from the domain 

* fckuattacker.cloudfront.com. 

Maybe networking attacks should work? right? maybe... "sOmE evNRiOnmEnts doEsn'T hAveE ProtEctIons"... ok then.. 
 
Networking hacking is more than "hacking", you MUST to do researching, perform simples packet tests with Wireshark (in this area, it's your best friend), and understand the basics of the basics of the basics.... of Network Layers. Obviously, it's not that hard to apply your knowledge on it, if you have one, in my case, it was PAINFULL.

Let's begin with the idea which you are outside from the network, and you only know that the target are called CONTOSO.
First of all, what do you do now? Target Wi-fi Access Point, obviously!

airodump-ng wlan0mon
-------------------------------------------------------------
bssid                   channel               essid
ce:4d:01:62:18:f5       6         OPEN        CONTOSO_GUEST
3a:73:30:c5:5a:d7       11        WEP         James3131
6a:d1:c4:6a:e3:b3       2         WPA2        Kof1999
de:56:86:f8:f6:bb       1         WPA2        wifi_dummy
...<snippet>...
ce:4d:01:a4:3d:b1       6         WPA2        <hidden>
ce:4d:01:b0:48:f0       6         WPA2        CONTOSO_CORP
-------------------------------------------------------------

Now!.. Have a look on these Wireless Access Points. What it mean for you?... Think about it, you need to perform some attack on CONTOSO company, where are the correct bssid's for it?

Yep!! [ce:4d:01:xx:xx:xx] BSSID's are from the same vendor, which means the same router vendor should be utilized simultaneously on different Access Points . Also, the Company Wireless Access-Point lies on Hidden Mode, it's easy to see that it's not 2 targets: CONTOSO_GUEST and CONTOSO_CORP, but three of them... BSSID: ce:4d:01:a4:3d:b1 (<hidden>) also are utilized for employeers. In the link below, the follow blogpost explain how to get the correct name of <hidden> Wireless Access Points and how to login without it:

* https://linuxconfig.org/discover-hidden-wifi-ssids-with-aircrack-ng
* https://askubuntu.com/questions/833905/how-can-i-connect-to-a-specific-bssid

Ok! now we know that are three Wireless Access Points to perform some attack.. ok.. how?.. 
Let's think about it a little bit:

1 - Ok, if i start to attack the CONTONSO_CORP and <hidden> Access Point, i need first of all to crack WPA-2, which is PAINFULL! 

2 - So... If i start from the CONTOSO_GUEST Access Point, i need to perform some Pivoting to the CORP network (if the same have connectivity for it!).

So.. let's start from the second option which is the more "reliable" to get something informations.

root@r00t# connect_wifi.sh CONTOSO_GUEST
<connected on CONTOSO_GUEST>

root@r00t# ifconfig wlan0
<192.168.28.42 / de:56:86:f8:f6:bb>

Yahoo! we're inside.. so.. what's now?...

Did you see that? the second redirect!! ... WTF is happening here? how the freaky i can have direct access on the GATEWAY Login?? 
 
 Yes!! it's the most common vulnerability on misconfigured environments!

Maybe admin:admin or admin:password? If you're appart of Firewalls / IDS / IPS, maybe PyDictor will save your time to perform some wordlist generation, which must be used for future bruteforce attacks!

Ok! now you now the follow informations:

Your Guest IP: <192.168.28.42 / de:56:86:f8:f6:bb
Gateway IP:    <192.168.28.1 / b2:04:3b:b7:d9:b6>

root@r00t# cat /var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases
...<snippet>...
DHCP Server:   <172.21.0.45 / 0e:ad:c4:aa:bc:0e>
DNS Server:    <172.21.0.45 / 0e:ad:c4:aa:bc:0e>

As you can see here.. Yes, mostly DHCP Servers are the same to DNS Servers. A tricky command with nmap, can show you also if your machine are receiving ACK resposes from another IP addresses. 

* https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/broadcast-dhcp-discover.html
* https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dhcp-discover.html

Also, this documentations about DHCP and DNS Protocol saved my life, it's awesome to know how these protocols work: 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System

DHCP Server are in another IP Range, which means we can't use ARP to perform Layer 2 scans.. oh well...
Wait!! what? Layer 2? ARP? ARP Spoof? what do you mean brah?!.. 
Yeah!! it was PAINFUL for me to understand it.. but let's recap some network basics:

Simple Network OSI Model - How Network Works!

Application Layer (7) -> HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet, SSH, IMAP, POP, SNMP, etc.
Presentation Layer (6) -> X.25, ZIP, XML, JSON, ASCII, EBCDIC, JPEG, MP3, etc.
Session Layer (5) -> NetBIOS, RPC, SOCKS, L2TP, SDP, H.245, NFS, etc.
Transport Layer (4) -> TCP, UDP, SPX, SCTP, RDP and DCCP.
Network Layer (3) -> IP, ICMP, IPsec, IPX, DDP, CLNP, etc.
Frames Layer (2) -> ARP / MAC Address, Ethernet, ARP, PPP, Token ring, StarLAN, NDP, L2TP, etc.
Bits Layer (1) -> ISDN, DSL, Bluetooth physical layer, CAN bus, USB physical layer, Ethernet physical layer, IEEE 1394, RS-232, etc. 

How do you utilize Application Layers protocols? 
How do you communicate to another person, websites, so on? It's all about encapsulation and decapsulation!!
