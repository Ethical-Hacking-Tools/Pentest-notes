A lovely hint for you all pentesters, and friends <3.

Download this 4 gits:
https://github.com/defcon-russia/metasploit-payloads
https://github.com/defcon-russia/metasploit-framework
https://github.com/d35ha/CallObfuscator
https://github.com/TheWover/donut

Have a look at this BlogPost:
http://asintsov.blogspot.com/2017/12/data-exfiltration-in-metasploit.html

Utilizing (donut.exe + CallObfuscator) modify all of your stagers inside meterpreter folder.
path: metasploit-framework/data/meterpreter/*

Finally, utilize windows/meterpreter/reverse_dns_tcp payload, which is a meterpreter staged (will download after reverse connection), but works as well in mostly situations!

Never be caught by IDS/IPS/Firewalls and Blueteam shitty softwares!

Be Happy!
